This script helps to create launchers, assisting in the compilation of a text file *.desktop according to the standards (http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/).

To simplify the process, it only implements basic functionality, for advanced uses I advise to change manually the launcher with a text editor.

I especially suggest, for those interested, the opportunity to delve:
• Addition of different locales to each field (According to the standards provided).
• Entering the launcher to the list of applications (~/.local/share/applications/).
• Adding the launcher to the dock in Unity with shortcuts to related commands (X-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts); (Note: only applications launchers can appear in the dock, but to emulate links just enter the command "xdg-open { file | URL }").

I want to point that this script was created as a personal utility without testing or warranties, so possible faults or damage are responsibility of the user.
