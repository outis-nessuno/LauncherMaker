h2. Description:

This script helps to create launchers, assisting in the compilation of a text file *.desktop according to the standards (http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/).

To simplify the process, it only implements basic functionality, for advanced uses I advise to change manually the launcher with a text editor.

I especially suggest, for those interested, the opportunity to delve:
* Addition of different locales to each field (According to the standards provided).
* Entering the launcher to the list of applications (~/.local/share/applications/).
* Adding the launcher to the dock in Unity with shortcuts to related commands (X-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts); (Note: only applications launchers can appear in the dock, but to emulate links just enter the command "xdg-open { file | URL }").

I want to point that this script was created as a personal utility without testing or warranties, so possible faults or damage are responsibility of the user.

h2. How to use:

# *Get the complete script:* you can find it already built from the download section of github in the top right of the page or on my website "http://outis.altervista.org/launchermaker/":http://outis.altervista.org/launchermaker/. Or you can get the full source code from the repository and build it yourself by running "build.sh".
# *Install it:* copy and paste to the directory of nautilus scripts (Should be: "~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts"). Make it executable (If necessary).
# *Run it:* context-menu (Right click) on nautilus > Script > LauncherMaker. Then follow the guided steps.
# *Celebrate:* you have a new utility, have fun! ;D

h2. How to modify:

It is a simple bash script, it is divided in logical almost self-explaining parts, it is commented and it is predisposed for translations...you shouldn't have any problems! So, get the repo and change what you want!
